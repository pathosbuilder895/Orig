"""
context/baseline_match.py — Phase 4: Contextual Baseline Matching.

Selects the subset of a student's baseline samples whose context most
closely matches the submission's manifest, and lazily backfills the
context metadata (genre + topic centroid) on legacy samples that
predate the adaptive layer.

The composite similarity score is:

    score = 0.4 · genre_similarity
          + 0.4 · topic_similarity
          + 0.2 · recency_weight

Genre similarity is a 3-step ladder (1.0 same label, 0.5 same family,
0.0 otherwise) using `GENRE_FAMILIES` from `constants.py`.

Topic similarity is `1 - cosine_distance` between the submission's TF-IDF
centroid and each sample's stored TF-IDF centroid. Both vectors come from
a per-student vectoriser (cached on `StudentState._tfidf_vectorizer`) fitted
once over the student's full sample corpus — so the vocabulary is consistent
across calls without leaking across students.

Recency weight is a simple linear ramp: most-recent sample (highest index)
= 1.0, oldest = 0.0.

Returns a tuple `(selected_indices, anchor_only)`. The caller (Phase 5
orchestrator) feeds `selected_indices` to `compute_full_features(...,
baseline_indices=...)`. When fewer than two samples score above
`min_similarity` we fall back to anchor-only scoring and signal that with
`anchor_only=True`.
